Overview
--------
This set of tools is designed to enable me to create ports in FreeBSD and
to then create suitable packages of those ports (and what I shall call meta-packages)

FreeBSD has a concept of a Package - a pre-built set of binaries and associated 
files that can be easily extracted onto a host and then just run.  
A package is essentially a tarred up version of a port after port is compiled.

I suspect if I knew more about pkg_add -r this would be simpler.  In fact after writing that line I went and looked up more about pkg_add, and changed how I did all this.  I do like making life complicated for myself.

Package Repository
------------------
The simple principle is that after building a port, one can easily create a package from that port by ::

  $ make package

(Is there a recursive make package? Ha - I am getting used to this stuff - there is a make package-recursive see man ports!!!)

This then puts a package into /usr/ports/packages/All/<port>.tgz

Then we make this directory available over FTP (or copy the packages to similar All/ directory elsewhere.)

On the client machine we set an environment variable::

  $ setenv PACKAGESITE ftp://my.server/packages/All/

  $ export PACKAGESITE=ftp://my.server/packages/All/

then I can run

  $ pkg_add -r <port>.tgz 

and (jhopefully) the port and its dependancies will be installed as normal








Making ports
------------
Subversion
~~~~~~~~~~
For the client ssvn, we do not particularly want to have a full apache on there, so we do NOT use the option "Use APR from Apache2", instead we build APR first, then build svn.  THat way no apache is built

For the SVN server, well we do not need apache either.
