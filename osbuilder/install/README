Standard PIRC Server Install Protocol
=====================================

1. bootstrap the server

Get bootstrap.sh and run `sh bootstrap.sh`.

It installs several packages deemed to be required on all of our standard 
servers.

* bash
* curl
* git
* python25
* screen
* sudo
* subversion
* mysql-client

2. Install server applications

Get the fabfile. It defines install recipes for apache, nginx, php and mysql 
servers.

To list the available tasks run `fab -l` in the same directory as the fabfile.

Aa an example, the following command will install mysql, configure its root 
user and install a non-standard my.cnf file

`fab deploy_mysql start_mysql`
