Building FreeBSD installs from scratch.
=======================================

This is a simple, personal project to do SoHo quality level BSD installs 
at home, to keep my servers up to date, without too much manual sysadmin.

THere are Jail setups, complete installs, buildworlds and more.

Does not use the new BSDInstall. I shall probably try migrating for the PXE part
