Rationale 
---------

I have run FreeBSD as a *workstation* for nearly a decade (as servers, longer).
But I have rarely spent enough time to really get underneath it, and feel
I *own* it.

However, everytime I touch a Linux distro I feel I am losing touch with
some essential part of knowing what is going on.  And PC-BSD feels exactly the
same.  I am more than happy to steal weird and wonderful xorg.conf files 
to get my monitor started, but I am reluctant to cede so much control and 
understanding for screen resolution and Skype.

Not building the services myself I lose out on knowing what's underneath.
And too many of the BSD'isms make sense to me to have it hidden by layers that
don't.  Probably I am just getting old.  It may be that I am just foolishly
prejudiced.  It may be Linux will run and run and take over from all and BSD's will fall by the wayside.

But in the meantime, I want to keep using this system.  And supporting if I can.
